********** Trunk **********
# added 'simplemonth' parameter; displays a simple month calendar (mini-calendar)
# added style classes for .singleEvent, .repeatEvent and .recurrenceEvent in default.css
# cleaning up the ical load tool by introducing purge/page refresh via code instead of the button
# added user triggered yearly repeating events, but not solid on a delimiter yet..currently, it identifies a yearly 
  repeat using the folowing ":# Eric's Birthday". This will take that event, convert it into an RRULE event and store 
  it with under "page/name/recurrence"
