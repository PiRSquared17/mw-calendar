# fixed $wgCalendarPath override


******** trunk/beta ******** 
# added support for {{TEMPLATE}} syntax for calendar name. 
	<calendar name={{TEMPLATE}} />

# added timetracking ability...creates a small table that maintains totals per category...categories are created on the fly...ie: sick... vacation... project name... anything you want. Entries will match existing entires and update the total values. Day events are only totaled for that month, but monthly/template events are totalled for the year
	(ex: ::sick-8) 
	(ex: ::project1:8) 
	(ex: ::project1-4) <<total 12>>
	(ex: 5-10# ::vacation-8) <-- template; totals for the year

# re-added repeating events under daily "add event" (ex: 5# Vacation)... this will create 5 vacation events

# added 'enablerepeatevents'... enabling this with double the load times because it pulls the previous months events (30 days X 5 events-per-day X 2 months)..basically hits the db 300 times..now double that for for each subscribed calendar...<sigh>

# added a few css style files to change the calendar look and feel

# removed the need for the $wgExtensionPath override; calendar can be anywhere now

# added 'enablelegacy'... I disabled the "CalanderEvents:Page/Title (12-1-2008) - Event 1" format by default...causes about 15% performance drain
