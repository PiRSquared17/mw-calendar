********** v3.5.0.2 **********
# fixed an issue with legacy events created in v3.0 and parts of v3.2; need to use 'enablelegacy' to view older events though

# moved from cookies to session states... this controls the 'month/year/today' buttons


********** Trunk **********
# re-ordered the template/add event list... it will now be templates 1st, then normal events

# added initial logic for basic ical imports (VCALENDAR)...event, summary and date; use the 'ical' parameter to activate the tool... defaults to adding a new event, but 'ical=usemultievent' will add concat all events to '-event 0'

# added effective date to 'enablelegacy' mode; this improves performace as the 
  code only looks for legacy events effective that day and prior.... the default is ALL

# added month, week and year quick view buttons
